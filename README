About the project
===================================
Xen-for-Cubietruck should help to getting started with Xen virtualization on arm.
The benefit of the project is that the developer can start rapidly with working on dom0 and different guests.

In future the project should also create grapical guest but therefore a lot of work on the sunxi-devel
kernel is nessescery to port the videodrivers(hdmi, lcd, display) on a xen compatible kernel.

GUI Virtualisation on Cubietruck would be a very cool feature and I hope I can inspire some kernel developers
to work on a port for the sunxi videodrivers on a xen compatible kernel.


Quick Start Guide
====================================

Starting the build skript
./build.sh


#Copy dom0 to the sdcard
sudo tar xfvz $PROJECT_DIR/build/images/dom0.tar.gz -C /media/fs

sudo mv /media/$ROOT_FS/binary/* /media/$ROOT_FS/
sudo rm -r /media/$ROOT_FS/binary


sudo dd if=$PROJECT_DIR/src/u-boot-sunxi/spl/sunxi-spl.bin of=/dev/$DEVICE bs=1024 seek=8
