About the project
===================================
Xen-for-Cubietruck should help to getting started with Xen virtualization on arm.
The benefit of the project is that the developer can start rapidly with working on dom0 and different guests.

In future the project should also create grapical guest but therefore a lot of work on the sunxi-devel
kernel is nessescery to port the videodrivers(hdmi, lcd, display) on a xen compatible kernel.

GUI Virtualisation on Cubietruck would be a very cool feature and I hope I can inspire some sunxi kernel developers
to work on a port for the sunxi videodrivers on a xen compatible kernel.


Quick Start Guide
====================================

There are 4 different linaro filesystems which can be used for dom0 and domU(Guest) systems.
*linaro_nano
*linaro_developer
*linaro_desktop

Command parameters
--add_domU=$FILESYSTEM
--dom0=$FILESYSTEM


Build a image with a dom0(linaro_developer) and 2 domUs with a linaro_developer and linaro_nano filesystem
./build.sh --dom0=linaro_developer --add_domU=linaro_nano --add_domU=linaro_developer

-Insert SD_Card and create a partiton table(Remaining Data will be lost!!!)

-The dom0_full.img image contain the dom0 and all domUs combined in a image.
 It's also possible to copy the dom0 and domUs seperatly (For example a harddisk can be used for the guests).
 The images are located in $PROJECT_DIR/build/images
sudo dd if=$PROJECT_DIR/build/images/dom0_full.img of=/dev/$DEVICE_NAME

-Write the UBoot to the sdcard
sudo dd if=$PROJECT_DIR/src/u-boot-sunxi/spl/sunxi-spl.bin of=/dev/$DEVICE_NAME bs=1024 seek=8
sudo dd if=$PROJECT_DIR/src/u-boot-sunxi/u-boot.img of=/dev/$DEVICE_NAME bs=1024 seek=40

-Starting the script to configure the dom0
chmod 0777 dom0_configure.sh
./dom0_configure.sh
